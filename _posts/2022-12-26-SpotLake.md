**SpotLake** is a system that collects, analyzes, evaluates, and distributes datasets related to spot instances\* provided on the public cloud. This project was motivated by the policy change of spot instance in 2017 by AWS, one of the most representative public cloud providers. Previous studies on spot instances became outdated as the policy changed from bidding to oracle. Instead, AWS began to provide datasets related to the availability publicly and interrupt frequency of spot instances. We collected these datasets after November 2021 and conducted a time-series analysis and evaluation with Spot Checker\*\*.

The data we collected were ‘Spot Placement Score’\*\*\*, ‘Interrupt-free Score’\*\*\*\*, and, ‘Spot Price’. First, we developed a query optimization method and a parallel data collector to overcome the API constraints of AWS. In the process of analyzing the collected data, we found that: 1. The availability of spot instances is correlated with the maturity of the computing hardware. 2. Spot Placement Score should be considered prioritized over Interrupt-free Score. 3. Abundance of dataset increase the accuracy of availability prediction. These results showed the possibility of building a cost-efficient and scalable workload processing cluster system with datasets of SpotLake. Being recognized for its contribution, the paper of SpotLake was presented at the 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization.
