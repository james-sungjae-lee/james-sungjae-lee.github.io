SpotLake is a system that collects, analyzes, evaluates, and distributes datasets related to spot instances\* provided on the public cloud. This project was motivated by the policy change of spot instance in 2017 by AWS, one of the most representative public cloud providers. Previous studies on spot instances became outdated as the policy changed from bidding to oracle. Instead, AWS began to provide datasets related to the availability publicly and interrupt frequency of spot instances. We collected these datasets after November 2021 and conducted a time-series analysis and evaluation with Spot Checker\*\*.
