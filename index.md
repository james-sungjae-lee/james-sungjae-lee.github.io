I am a student research assistant in the [DDPS Lab](https://ddps.cloud){:target="_blank"} at [Kookmin University](https://kookmin.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}. I am broadly motivated by the goal of efficient distributed system, focusing on core challenges related to system for machine learning, performance modeling, and transient cloud computing. At Kookmin University, I conducted research about efficient deep learning system with my advisor [Dr. Kyungyong Lee](http://leeky.me){:target="_blank"}.
