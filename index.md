I am a student research assistant in the [DDPS Lab](https://ddps.cloud){:target="_blank"} at [Kookmin University](https://kookmin.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}. My research goal is to build efficient systems for AI with cutting-edge cloud technologies. To achieve this goal, I conducted research projects on Deep Learning Systems, Serverless Computing, Edge Computing, and Spot Instances. At Kookmin University, I focused on the project about cost-effective deep learning systems with my advisor [Professor Kyungyong Lee](http://leeky.me){:target="_blank"}.
